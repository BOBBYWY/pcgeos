COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		X10Strategy
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Call the correct driver function when passed a legal
            command.

CALLED BY:	External

PASS:		di	-> command

RETURN:		see routines

DESTROYED:	di

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		The command is passed in di.  Look up the near pointer
		to the routine that handles that command in a jump table
		and jump to it.

KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
		none

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		X10...Near
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	A near routine to make a far call through

CALLED BY:	Strategy Routine
PASS:		<see routine>
RETURN:		<see routine>
DESTROYED:	nothing
SIDE EFFECTS:
		<see routine>

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		There are a couple of routines which don't need
		to remain resident at all times.  There are many
		way to call such routines, but to make calling
		the other routines as fast as possible (and the
		other routines are time-critical rouines that
		get called at interrupt time...), we do near
		calls to everything.

		Since some of the routines are not in this code
		segment, however, we are actualy doing near
		calls to routines which to Far calls to the
		routines.

		Get it?
